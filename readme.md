Design an API with 3 endpoints:
each endpoint must have their own Controller file, inside the Controller folder
Also, each one must have their own service file, inside a Service folder
Peer Review: Zahid Afsar: his first two end points work well and the code looks good, the last endpoint was not working and he is missing his service files
